/**
 * The implementation of the tiger() function is based on the corresponding
 * function in the tigertree project:
 *    https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigertree/
 * Which in turn states that the code is almost a literal copy from the
 * original Tiger authors code. It can be found at:
 *    http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger
 *
 * The functions tiger_int() and tiger_leaf() are implemented by me. These are
 * built on top of the (internal) tiger_compress() function. These 2 functions
 * are faster than the generic tiger() function for the specific case of
 * tiger-tree calculations.
