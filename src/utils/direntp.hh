// we need an implementation of dirent that returns UTF8-encoded strings
// as chars.
// Unfortunately, MinGW's implementation of dirent provides either
// wchar_t-based versions that support UTF16 (when UNICODE is defined),
// or char-based versions containing what appear to be ANSI strings,
// certainly not UTF8.
// While this behavior is relatively consistent with Win32, it's not
// what we need here. Consequently, we use our wrapper instead.
