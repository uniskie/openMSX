Keyboard related settings in hardwareconfig.xml

In section <PPI>...</PPI>:

Setting name: key_ghosting
Default value: true
Description:
If true, the emulator will press 'ghost' keys when user presses multiple keys
at once on crossing rows/columns of the keyboard matrix.
It must be set to true for all MSX models that suffer from this hardware problem

Setting name: key_ghosting_sgc_protected
Default value: true
Description:
If true, the key ghosting routine in the emulator will protect Shift, Graph
and Code keys from key-ghosting. According to schematics and tests, several
European machines have such a protection but some Japanese machines don't have it.
In the protected machines, those three keys are connected to the keyboard matrix
via a Diode, which prevents that pressing those two or more of those three
keys together would ghost to other rows/columns via the 'character key' that you press
in combination with them.


Setting name: keyboard_type
Default value: int
Description:
Indicates which type of keyboard the MSX has. It is used to load a file that
maps unicode characters to the appropriate key-combinations on the MSX.
The file-name will be: unicodemaps/unicode.<keyboard_type>

Setting name: has_keypad
Default value: true
Description:
Indicates if the emulated MSX model has a numeric keypad. If true, key-presses
on the host numeric keypad will be mapped to corresponding key-presses on
the MSX's numeric keypad.
If false, key-presses on the host numeric keypad will be ignored. User can
overrule this with a setting in the settings.xml file.

Setting name: code_kana_locks
Default value: false
Description:
When true, the the CODE/KANA key locks on the emulated machine. Is in practice the
behaviour of all Japanese MSX models and of the VG8010.
If false, CODE/KANA key does not lock (e.g. it is only active as long as the key is
pressed)

In section <PSG>...</PSG>:
Setting name: keyboardlayout
Default value: <empty>
Description:
Indicates if the "keyboard mode" flag (bit 6 on PSG register 14) must be set.
It will be set to "1" if keyboardlayout is JIS. Otherwise it will be 0.
In practice, this bit is only read by the Japanese ROM-BIOS to determine
the keyboard layout; Japanese-JIS or Japanese-ANSI
See http://map.tni.nl/articles/keymatrix.php for further details about
Japanese keyboard layouts.
Note that this setting is ignored by the keyboard driver of openMSX. The
keyboard driver only looks at the keyboard_type parameter in the PPI
section to determine which unicode to keycombination mapping to apply.
