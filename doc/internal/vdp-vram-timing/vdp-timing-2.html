<h2>Follow-up</h2>

<h5>V9938</h5>

<p>This text is a follow-up on the earlier <a href="vdp-timing.html">V9938 VRAM
timings</a> document. If you haven't done so already it's probably a very good
idea to (re-)read that document first, because this text assumes you remember
all the earlier details ;-)</p>

<p>Early 2013 the openMSX team made some logic-analyzer-measurements of the
actual communication between a V9938 and the connected VRAM. The goal of those
measurements was to improve the emulation of the VDP command engine in openMSX.
That goal was fully achieved: to the best of our knowledge the timing of the
VDP command engine is now fully accurate: e.g. recent versions of openMSX now
generate identical pictures as real MSX machines for the LINE-speed test
picture shown in the <a href="vdp-timing.html#motivation">motivation</a>
section of the previous document.</p>

<p>A nice side effect of these measurements was that, next to the command
engine speed, we also obtained information about what happens when the CPU
(Z80) reads or writes the VRAM too fast, and what exactly is "too fast". This
behaviour is now also implemented in openMSX, though only (yet) for the V9938
bitmap screen modes (the information in this text should allow us to also
implement the timing for the other screen modes).</p>

<p>Because the focus was the command engine and because a V9938 can only
execute commands in bitmap screen modes (screen 5-8), our measurements were
mostly focused on those screen modes. And especially the analysis of the
results was initially focused on the bitmap screen modes. In this text we will
now look at the other screen modes, even though there is less measurement data
available for those modes.</p>

<h5>TMS9918</h5>

<p>The second half of this text looks at the TMS9918 VDP. We only made
measurements on a V9938 and as we'll see below the results cannot be
extrapolated to TMS9918. Luckily there are other sources of information
available that allow to piece together similar (though less detailed) timing
diagrams for the TMS9918 as for the V9938.</p>

<h5>results</h5>
<p>Similar like in the previous document, we'll start by presenting all the
results in one big diagram. I strongly recommend to open this image in an image
viewer that easily allows to scroll and zoom-in and -out (so maybe not a
web-browser). It may also be useful to have this image open while reading the
later sections in this text.</p>

  <img src="vdp-timing-v2.png" width="1200"/>

<p>At the top of this diagram the results of the previous article are repeated,
these are the V9938 bitmap modes. In the middle are the V9938 character- and
text-modes. And at the bottom you see the TMS9918 results. They're all included
in one big diagram to allow to more easily compare them.</p>

<p>Horizontally you see the detailed timing of one display line. On V9938 one
line takes 1368 cycles, on TMS9918 it takes 342 cycles. The line is divided in
different phases (indicated by the different background colors) corresponding
to the left- and right-border, display cycle, etc. Notice that the text modes
have different border widths than the other modes. Also notice that the lengths
of these periods are not exactly the same between the two VDP types.</p>

<p>Because these horizontal phases don't fully correspond between the two VDP
types, I had to make a choice in how to align the results of both VDPs. I
choose to align the display cycle (the period where the actual pixels are
shown). Though this means that 'cycle 0' is not located in exactly the same
horizontal position for both VDPs. But this doesn't matter: as explained in the
previous article, 'cycle 0' is anyway an arbitrary choice. Just keep it in mind
when comparing the results.</p>

<p>For the V9938 the diagram shows the RAS and CAS0/1 signals, for TMS9918 that
information is missing. But that's OK: on V9938 there are burst and non-burst
accesses, there are idle cycles, dummy accesses, etc. So the RAS/CAS signals do
provide extra information. As we'll see in the 2nd half of this text, on
TMS9918 the communication with the VRAM is much simpler, so the RAS/CAS signals
anyway don't contribute as much extra information.</p>



<h2>V9938 (MSX2 VDP)</h2>

<h3>Character modes</h3>

<p>In this section we'll look at the 3 character-based display modes: Graphics
Mode 1, Graphics Mode 2 and Multi-color Mode (aka screen 1, 2 and 3). As we'll
see, from a VRAM access point of view, these 3 modes are closely related.</p>

<h4>Graphics mode 2 (aka screen 2)</h4>

<h5>refresh</h5>
<p>The VRAM needs to be regularly refreshed. The V9938 does this by regular
reads (from all banks of the DRAM chips). Those reads are located at the
following moments in time (VDP cycle counts within one display line). Remember
that one display line has 1368 VDP cycles and that cycle 0 is semi-arbitrarily
chosen within the line (so only relative numbers matter).</p>
<table>
<tr><td>284</td><td>412</td><td>540</td><td>668</td>
    <td>796</td><td>924</td><td>1052</td><td>1180</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that these are the exact same locations as for the bitmap screen
modes.</p>

<h5>character rendering</h5>
<p>To be able to render each character we need to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Read 1 byte from the name-table &rarr;
     Which character should be displayed?</li>
 <li>Read 1 byte from the pattern-table &rarr;
     How does (this line of) that character look?</li>
 <li>Read 1 byte from the color-table &rarr;
     What are the colors of (this line of) that character?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 32 characters on a line, so these 3 reads also repeat 32 times.
The name-, pattern- and color-table reads are located at these respective
moments in time:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>214 + 32n + 0</td><td>214 + 32n + 18</td><td>214 + 32n + 24</td><td>with 0 &le; n &lt; 32</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Notice there's some room between the name-table read and the
pattern-/color-table reads. <i>The address required to read from the latter two
tables depends on the result obtained from the first read. So possibly there's
extra room at this location to give the VDP more time to calculate those
addresses.</i> In fact there fit exactly 2&times;6 cycles between the name- and
pattern-table read. This leaves room for 2 other VRAM accesses:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The first of those is used for refresh (once every 4 characters) or as a
     potential CPU/cmd access slot.</li>
 <li>The second access is used to read 32 sprite y-coordinates. These are
     required to figure out which of the 32 possible sprites are visible on
     the next display line.</li>
</ul>


<h5>sprite rendering</h5>
<p>Above we saw there are 32 reads to figure out which sprites are visible. In
this section we'll see what additional VRAM reads are performed to actually
render the visible sprites.</p>

<p>In sprite mode 1 there are maximally 4 sprites visible on a line. For each
of those we need to read the sprite attributes (this is the x- and
y-coordinate, the sprite pattern number and the sprite color). And we also need
to read 1 or 2 bytes from the sprite-pattern-table (for 8&times;8 or
16&times;16 sprites). Similar to sprite mode 2, the y-coordinate is re-read
(the sprite-visibility pass already read it). The VDP always reads 2 sprite
pattern bytes (for 8&times;8 sprites that 2nd byte is ignored). And even if
fewer than 4 sprites are actually visible, the VDP always performs VRAM reads
for all 4 sprites (and ignores the results of the redundant reads).</p>
<ul>
 <li>The 4 sprite attributes are read (using a burst read) at times:
 <table>
 <tr><td>x+0</td><td>x+4</td><td>x+8</td><td>x+12</td><td>with x = 1242, 1306, 6, 70</td></tr>
 </table>
 </li>
 <li>The 2 sprite pattern bytes are read (also using a burst read) at times:
 <table>
 <tr><td>x+0</td><td>x+4</td><td>with x = 1274, 1342, 38, 102</td></tr>
 </table>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Next there are a bunch of dummy reads:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The burst that reads the 4 attribute bytes is extended with 2 dummy reads
     (often but not always these seem to read the x,y-coordinates of the 31st
     sprite).</li>
 <li>For every (burst) read from the sprite-pattern-table, 16 cycles later,
     there's a second dummy (burst) read of 2 bytes from the sprite pattern
     table.</li>
 <li>Right after every read from the sprite-pattern-table (4&times;2 times),
     there's a 1 byte read from closely before the start of the
     sprite-attribute-table (where in sprite mode 2 the sprite-color-table is
     located).</li>
</ul>
<p>(As you may have guessed already) all these dummy reads can be explained by
looking at how the V9938 implements sprite mode 2:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Per group of 2 sprites (4 groups), sprite mode 2 reads 6 bytes from the
     sprite attribute table (using a single(*) burst read). Sprite mode 1 reads
     4&times;(4+2) bytes (in a single burst). In both cases that's 24 bytes
     total.</li>
 <li>In total, sprite mode 2 reads 8&times;2 bytes from the
     sprite-pattern-table. Sprite mode 1 reads (4+4)&times;2 bytes.</li>
 <li>In total, sprite mode 2 reads 8 bytes from the sprite-color-table. Sprite
     mode 1 does 8 dummy reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>(*)<i>Actually, this is not true. But I believe this is how it was
intended: the 6 bytes are located in the same DRAM bank. In reality the
V9938 performs 2 burst reads of 3 bytes each. But because there are only
28 cycles available it has to use a, strictly speaking, invalid DRAM
timing. See previous article for more details.</i></p>

<p>So the timing of all sprite mode 2 reads is (almost) identical to all the
sprite mode 1 normal + dummy reads, only slightly shifted in time.</p>

<p><i>I guess all these dummy reads in sprite mode 1 are the result of
chip-area optimizations done by Yamaha engineers. In the current design the
same state machine can generate the CAS/RAS signals for both sprite modes. And
similarly a large part of the address generation logic for sprite mode 1 and 2
can be shared.</i> But unfortunately it does mean the VRAM bandwidth used for
those dummy reads is not available for CPU VRAM access or (on V9958) for
command execution.</p>

<h5>dummy reads</h5>
<p>Next to all the dummy reads related to sprite rendering, there are also
dummy reads at these moments in time:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>182</td><td>200</td><td>206</td><td>1218</td></tr>
</table>
<p>These are the locations where you would expect respectively reads from the
name-, pattern-, color-, and sprite-attribute-table if you'd extend a display
line to 33 instead of 32 characters. This is similar to how in the bitmap
screen modes there is a dummy preamble for the bitmap data and a dummy
postamble for the sprite y-coordinate. All 4 dummy reads read address
0x1ffff.</p>

<h5>CPU/command-engine access slots</h5>
<p>These are the available CPU/cmd access slots:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>32</td><td>96</td><td>166</td><td>174</td><td>188</td>
    <td>220</td><td>252</td><td>316</td><td>348</td><td>380</td></tr>
<tr><td>444</td><td>476</td><td>508</td><td>572</td><td>604</td>
    <td>636</td><td>700</td><td>732</td><td>764</td><td>828</td></tr>
<tr><td>860</td><td>892</td><td>956</td><td>988</td><td>1020</td>
    <td>1084</td><td>1116</td><td>1148</td><td>1212</td><td>1268</td></tr>
<tr><td>1334</td></tr>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is very similar to the CPU/cmd slots in bitmap mode with sprites
enabled. In both cases there are 31 available slots and the largest distance
between (the start of) two slots is 70 VDP cycles. Only some of the slots
are slightly shifted when comparing both modes.</p>


<h4>Graphics mode 1 (aka screen 1)</h4>

<p>From a VRAM access point of view this mode is quasi identical to Graphics
mode 2. It does exactly the same number of VRAM reads as Graphics mode 2 at
exactly the same moments in time. Only the addresses in the color-table are a
bit different. So it does re-read the same color information for all 8 lines
in a character.</p>


<h4>Multi-color mode (aka screen 3)</h4>

<p>Maybe surprisingly, from a VRAM access point of view, also this mode is
quasi identical to Graphics mode 2. This mode doesn't have a color-table. But
the V9938 still uses the same VRAM access schema as it uses for Graphics mode
2. The reads from the color-table are replaced with dummy reads from address
0x1ffff, but all the rest is identical.</p>

<p>So unfortunately the VRAM bandwidth used to access the color-table does not
become available for CPU-VRAM access (or the command engine on V9958).</p>


<h3>Text modes</h3>
<p>Now we'll look at the two text modes. We'll again see that, from a VRAM
access point of view, both modes are very similar.</p>

<h4>Text mode 2 (aka screen 0, width 80)</h4>

<h5>refresh</h5>
<p>In all V9938 bitmap and character modes the refresh was handled identically.
For text modes it's different. Now there are only 7 (instead of 8) refresh
reads per display line and they are clustered together near the start of the
line, located at these moments in time:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>74</td><td>82</td><td>90</td><td>98</td>
    <td>106</td><td>114</td><td>122</td></tr>
</table>
<p><i>So apparently 7 refreshes per line are enough to keep the DRAM content
intact. Too bad the other screen modes use 8. Also using only 7 could have made
command execution slightly faster.</i></p>

<h5>dummy reads</h5>
<p>There are 2 dummy reads from address 0x1ffff located at:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>230</td><td>238</td></tr>
<table>

<h5>text rendering</h5>
<p>The text rendering itself is pretty straight-forward. We need to read 80
bytes from the name-table and also 80 bytes from the pattern-table (the
pattern-addresses depend on the values read from the name-table). For the blink
color feature we also need 80 bits (10 bytes) from the color-table.</p>

<p>Rendering is performed in 20 groups of 4 characters. Each group starts
reading 4 bytes from the name-table using a burst read, these reads are
located at:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>g+0</td><td>g+4</td><td>g+8</td><td>g+12</td></tr>
</table>
<p>with g one of:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>246</td><td>294</td><td>342</td><td>390</td><td>438</td>
    <td>486</td><td>534</td><td>582</td><td>630</td><td>678</td></tr>
<tr><td>726</td><td>774</td><td>822</td><td>870</td><td>918</td>
    <td>966</td><td>1014</td><td>1062</td><td>1110</td><td>1158</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Next we read 1 byte from the color-table (at cycle g+18). This gives 8 bits,
so we only need to do this for every other group (in the other group this
access is used as a CPU/cmd access slot). Last we read 4 bytes from the pattern
table. These must be non-burst reads because potentially bits 15-8 of the
pattern-address for each character are different. These reads start at:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>g+24</td><td>g+30</td><td>g+36</td><td>g+42</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that combined all reads in 1 group take 48 cycles, and that's also the
distance between 2 groups (in character mode there where a few spare cycles in
a group). So it is really required to process the characters in groups of 4,
otherwise burst reads aren't possible and all the required VRAM accesses don't
fit in the available cycle budget (1 narrow pixel is 2 VDP cycles, thus 4
characters of each 6 pixels take 48 cycles).</p>


<h5>CPU/command-engine access slots</h5>
<p>These are the positions of the available CPU/cmd access slots:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>18</td><td>26</td><td>34</td>
    <td>42</td><td>50</td><td>58</td><td>66</td><td>166</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>182</td><td>190</td><td>198</td><td>206</td>
    <td>214</td><td>222</td><td>312</td><td>408</td><td>504</td></tr>
<tr><td>600</td><td>696</td><td>792</td><td>888</td><td>984</td>
    <td>1080</td><td>1176</td><td>1206</td><td>1214</td><td>1222</td></tr>
<tr><td>1230</td><td>1238</td><td>1246</td><td>1254</td><td>1262</td>
    <td>1270</td><td>1278</td><td>1286</td><td>1294</td><td>1302</td></tr>
<tr><td>1310</td><td>1318</td><td>1326</td><td>1336</td><td>1346</td>
    <td>1354</td><td>1362</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are 47 access slots, but they are very unevenly distributed. Often the
distance between two slots is 96 cycles, and one time even 100 VDP cycles! This
means that, even though there are more slots compared to bitmap/character mode,
the Z80 must access the VRAM more slowly in this mode! So to be safe there must
be 20 Z80 cycles between two CPU-VRAM accesses (see previous article for the
details of this calculation).</p>


<h4>Text mode 1 (aka screen 0, width 40)</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, from a VRAM access point of view, Text mode 1 is
similar to Text mode 2. Actually from a VRAM access allocation point of view
it's identical, only the actually VRAM read addresses are different. This may
seem strange because Text mode 1 logically needs a lot less data than Text mode
2. This is because over half of the performed reads are dummy reads:</p>
<ul>
 <li>In Text mode 1 there are still 4 (burst) reads from the name-table, but the
     3rd and 4th are dummy reads. In our (limited) measurements the address for
     read 3 and 4 was the same as for read 2, but with CAS1 active instead of
     CAS0 (but doesn't really matter as the result is ignored).</li>
 <li>There are also 10 dummy reads at the locations that are reserved for reads
     from the color-table. All these read address 0x1ffff.</li>
 <li>And similarly there are 4 reads from the pattern-table, but the 3rd and
     4th read address 0x1ffff.</li>
</ul>

<h5>CPU/command-engine access slots</h5>
<p>The available CPU/cmd access slots are identical to those in Text mode 2.
<i>It's unfortunate there are so many dummy reads in this mode. If this wasn't
the case, the available VRAM bandwidth for CPU accesses (or commands on V9958)
could have been a lot higher. Especially because the Z80 already cannot access
VRAM very fast in this mode. And also because, as we'll see below, on TMS9918
there's no such timing constraint for this mode.</i></p>



<h3>Stuff not measured</h3>

<p>There are a number of V9938 cases we don't have measurements for. As already
said in the beginning of this text, the original goal of these measurements was
to improve the accuracy of the command engine emulation. And we only had a very
limited amount of time the day we did this experiment. Re-doing the experiment
is certainly possible and not even that hard. But it takes a lot of time to
setup, for, as we'll see below, not too much useful extra knowledge. But of
course I'd be very happy to hear from other people who do want to repeat and/or
extend our measurements!</p>

<h4>Graphics mode 3 (aka screen 4)</h4>
<p>This uses very likely the same timing as Graphics mode 2 (aka screen 2), but
with the address generation logic of sprite mode 1 replaced with the one for
sprite mode 2. The timing of all VRAM accesses, even the sprite accesses, can
remain identical. <i>The existence of this screen mode might have been
(another) reason to design the timing of sprite mode 1 on V9938 in such a
strange way.</i></p>

<h4>Character modes with sprites disabled</h4>
<p>In bitmap modes, when sprite rendering is disabled, the VRAM bandwidth that
was allocated to sprite rendering becomes available for CPU/cmd accesses. Likely
the same is true for character modes (and text modes never have sprites).
Unfortunately since we didn't measure this combination we don't know exactly
where those slots are located. But it should be possible to make a very
reasonable estimate.</p>

<h4>Text modes with screen disabled (or vertical border)</h4>
<p>All non-text modes behave identical when screen display is disabled (and the
behavior during screen disabled is identical to the behavior during vertical
border lines): the VRAM reads for screen- and sprite-rendering are gone and
replaced by CPU/cmd access slots, but e.g. the refresh accesses remain. In the
2 text modes those refresh accesses are located in different positions compared
to bitmap/character modes. It's not known whether:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Screen-disabled in text-mode is the same as screen-disabled in the other
     screen modes.</li>
 <li>Or whether it has a dedicated schema with the refresh-reads in the same
     positions as in the text-mode screen-enabled case.</li>
<!-- TODO S#2 HR bit in vertical border, screen-disabled -->
</ul>
<p>This might make a difference for the exact position of the CPU/cmd access
slots. But because there are usually plenty of slots available in screen-off
mode, this likely won't matter (much).</p>


<h2>TMS9918 (MSX1 VDP)</h2>
<p>All our measurements were performed on a V9938 (MSX2 VDP). It's very likely
we can extrapolate the results to a V9958 (MSX2+ VDP). But for sure we cannot
use these results to derive anything meaningful for the TMS9918. Fortunately
there already is some interesting information available in
<a href="http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/vdp-99xx/">these documents</a> from
Karl Guttag. Especially this
<a href="http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/vdp-99xx/e2/1978_9918_Master_Timing_by_Serigio_Maggi.jpg">
timing picture</a> looks promising. Combined with information found in the
<a href="http://map.grauw.nl/resources/video/texasinstruments_tms9918.pdf">
TMS9918 application manual</a> I was able to deduce the stuff below. <i>This
wasn't easy because that timing picture does contain some (confusing) mistakes,
although I can easily forgive those mistakes because drawing this stuff by hand
is very tedious</i> ;-)</p>


<h5>general (memory) timings</h5>
<p>The TMS9918 runs at 5.37MHz (1.5&times;3.58MHz, 4&times; slower than the
V9938). One display line takes 342 cycles (as expected, 4&times; less than on
V9938). One memory access takes only 2 cycles or 372ns. So compared to V9938
each memory access takes slightly longer (on V9938 one access takes 6 cycles or
279ns). The TMS9918 never uses burst memory reads.</p>

<h5>Graphics mode 2 (aka screen 2)</h5>
<p>For the actual arrangement of the accesses I'll refer to the big timing
diagram (see top of this article). Most things are reasonably straight-forward.
One notable thing is the arrangement of the 32 sprite y-coordinate reads (for
the visibility check): the first 8 follow a different pattern than the last 24.
This is done to not have too long periods without CPU VRAM access slot. Reading
the other sprite data (during the horizontal border) also shows some
irregularities. Like on V9938, the y-coordinates of the visible sprites are
read twice, but apart from these 4 redundant reads, there are no dummy reads or
idle cycles (unlike V9938). It is not known whether the TMS9918 performs reads
for sprites that are not actually visible or that those slots are available for
CPU access (V9938 performs dummy reads).</p>

<p>The TMS9918 application manual mentions in section 2.1.5 "&hellip; CPU
windows occur once every 16 memory cycles &hellip;". This confirms the
above.</p>


<h5>Graphics mode 1 (aka screen 1)</h5>
<p>I couldn't find anything specific about the timing of this mode in the above
documentation. But because it requires the same number of reads from VRAM as
Graphics mode 2, it's logical to assume the timing is identical.</p>

<h5>Multi-color mode (aka screen 3)</h5>
<p>The documentation also doesn't have specific timing information for this
mode. In this mode the color-table isn't used, so one possibility is that
accesses to the color-table are replaced by CPU access slots (not the case on
V9938). This is confirmed by the following quote from the application manual,
section 2.1.5 "&hellip; in the Multicolor mode, CPU windows occur at least once
out of every four memory cycles &hellip;". Though when you look at the
sprite-accesses in the horizontal border area this quote isn't true: there's
still one location where there are 15 memory cycles between 2 CPU access slots!
<i>On the other hand, it would be possible to distribute the sprite and cpu
accesses more evenly in the horizontal border. So maybe that hand-drawn timing
picture is wrong? Or maybe it doesn't correspond to the final TMS9918
design?</i></p>

<h5>Text mode 1 (aka screen 0, width 40)</h5>
<p>Again see the big timing diagram. There's nothing really special about this
mode. The following quote from the application manual confirms this
arrangement: section 2.1.5 "&hellip; In the Text mode the CPU windows occur at
least once out of every three memory cycles &hellip;". Note that reads from the
name-table are not immediately followed by reads from the pattern-table.
<i>Possibly because the addresses in the latter table depend on the results
from the former reads and the VDP needs time to calculate those
addresses.</i></p>

<h5>display-disabled</h5>
<p>On TMS9918 there's no register that allows to disable sprite rendering
(there is on V9938), but it is possible to disable the whole screen rendering.
The documentation does hint that the screen-disabled behavior is the same as
the behavior during the vertical border (just as on V9938).</p>

<p>You may have noticed that in the above TMS9918 display-mode sections we
didn't mention any refresh reads. Also note that the hand-drawn TMS9918 timing
picture mentions something called 'refresh mode' (but nothing called 'vertical
border' or 'screen-disabled'). So I believe that on TMS9918 the VRAM is not
refreshed during each display line, but instead it's refreshed during the
vertical border.</p>

<p>On V9938 each display line performs 8 refresh reads (only 7 in text mode),
so it takes 64 lines or about 4ms to refresh 128kB VRAM (and only 2ms if you
rely on RAS-without-CAS refresh). On TMS9918 each vertical border line performs
32 refresh reads. So during the whole vertical border the full 16kB VRAM is
fully refreshed multiple times. Though between two vertical borders there are
192 display lines or about 12ms. So DRAM chips connected to TMS9918 have to be
able to retain their content longer without refresh than those connected to
V9938. The TMS9918 refresh schema does make more efficient use of the available
VRAM bandwidth (only do refresh when there's plenty of bandwidth available). On
the other hand the TMS9918 schema would make something like the
V9938-overscan-trick impossible (overscan = show display lines everywhere,
'skip' the vertical border).</p>

<h5>MSX1 CPU-VRAM access</h5>
<p>So what do the above timings mean for a MSX1 Z80 programmer? In various fora
(MSX or other) you find discussions about how fast it's allowed to access the
VRAM (read/write data from/to IO port 0x98). The general consensus seems to be
"at least 29 Z80 cycles between two accesses". For example an OUT(#99),A
instruction takes 12 cycles (on MSX), so you need 17 extra cycles before the
next such instruction.</p>

<p>This value of 29 cycles seems to come directly from the TMS9918 application
manual: it says in the worst case there must be 6&micro;s+2&micro;s=8&micro;s
between two accesses. Translated to Z80 cycles this gives 28.6 and rounded up
29 Z80 cycles. Though IMHO this result isn't very satisfactory. That value
8&micro;s is only given with one significant digit, so it could just as well be
7.5&micro;s or 8.5&micro;s. Rounded up to the nearest Z80 cycle that's between
27 and 31 Z80 cycles. Many people use the 29-cycles rule and apparently that
works fine in practice. But you also see reports that only 28 cycles
often(?)/always(?) work as well. It would be nice if we could measure the
exact value.</p>

<p><i>That value 2&micro;s is also mentioned in table 2.2 of the TMS9918
application manual. Other values in that table seem to be accurate to
&plusmn;0.05&micro;s, so it's possible (even likely?) those 2&micro;s can be
read as 2.0&micro;s. It must be an integer multiple of VDP clock cycles: 10
cycles is 1.86&micro;s, 11 cycles is 2.05&micro;s. If I have to make a guess
I'd pick the latter (this still results in a total CPU-VRAM access time of 29
Z80 cycles). Though in the rest of this text I'm still assuming the larger
uncertainty interval.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes you find discussions about when it's allowed to go faster than the
worst case requirement. Here the consensus is that in the vertical border you
can go as fast as you want (seems to be correct, see below). Sometimes you see
suggestions that it's also fine to go faster in the horizontal border or when
sprites aren't used (this seems wrong, or at least only partly correct).</p>

<p>Anyway, in the remainder as this section I'd like to dig a little deeper.
Now that the exact VRAM access allocation schemas are known we can say a little
more. But unfortunately some details will remain unclear.</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>In the worst case (Graphics mode 1 and 2) there are 16 memory cycles
     (32 VDP cycles, 21.3 Z80 cycles) between two CPU slots. The application
     manual also mentions an additional CPU-access waiting time of 2&micro;s.
     Though as explained above that could be anywhere from
     1.5&micro;s to 2.5&micro;s, this is between 8 to 13 VDP cycles or 5 to 9
     Z80 cycles. <i>(It's not clear where this time is coming from, maybe
     something similar to the V9938 'slot-reservation' delay of 16 cycles).</i>
     Combined this gives between 26.7 and 30.2 Z80 cycles. But unfortunately
     this isn't more accurate than the range we already found above.</p>
     <p>In this <a href="http://www.msx.org/forum/development/msx-development/bitbuster-depack-vram?page=6">
     post</a> dvik suggests it's OK to use tighter timings when "sprites aren't
     used". This would mean that the memory slots that are otherwise used for
     sprite rendering are given to the CPU. But what does that mean "sprites
     aren't used"? If it means there simply aren't any sprites visible, the
     TMS9918 still has to fetch 32 y-coordinates to figure out there indeed
     aren't any sprites visible (and then it can maybe omit the reads for the
     actual sprite rendering). But this doesn't improve the worst case timing.
     Another possibility is to explicitly disable sprite rendering. TMS9918 has
     no bit in some register to do this. The only possibility I see is to have
     a sprite with y-coordinate = 208. It <b>might</b> indeed be the case that
     the TMS9918 stops fetching sprite y-coordinates in this scenario (the
     V9938 does not), but without further tests I personally wouldn't trust
     this. It would be nice if someone could confirm or reject this
     theory.</p></li>
 <li><p>In the best case (the vertical border), there are only 4 VDP cycles
     between CPU slots. Taking the uncertainty of those '2&micro;s' into
     account, that results in a minimum distance of 8-12 Z80 cycles between two
     VRAM accesses. The fastest Z80 I/O instruction takes 12 cycles (on MSX,
     taking the extra Z80 wait cycle into account). So this confirms that in
     the vertical border you can indeed access VRAM as fast as you want.</p></li>
 <li><p>Text mode has maximum 6 VDP cycles between CPU slots. So rounded that's
     somewhere between 10 and 13 Z80 cycles. So it's <i>likely</i> OK to also
     in text mode access the VRAM as fast as you want, but we can only be
     certain if we know a more accurate value for those '2&micro;s'. It's worth
     repeating that on V9938 you can <b>not</b> access VRAM as fast in this
     mode. Keep that in mind when writing MSX1 software that needs to be upwards
     compatible with MSX2.</p></li>
 <li><p>Multi-color mode is unclear: the application manual says there's a CPU
     slot at least every 4 memory accesses. But as explained above I don't
     believe this (it's true for the display area, but not for the horizontal
     border). If it were true you only need 11-15 Z80 cycles between two
     CPU-VRAM accesses. But if you do take the border into account you get
     26-29 Z80 cycles, thus only slightly better than Graphics mode 2.</p></li>
