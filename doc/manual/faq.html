<h2><a id="install">Installing openMSX</a></h2>

<h3><a id="easyinstall">What is the easiest way to install openMSX?</a></h3>

<p>
The easiest way to install openMSX is to use a ready-made package. Whether or not one
is available depends on your operating system:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Windows</dt>
<dd>The easiest way to install openMSX is by running the installer. Download the
installer from
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/">our website</a> (check out the
Download box), unpack the <code>.zip</code> file, and double-click on the
resulting <code>.msi</code> file. After this, you should have a working openMSX
and openMSX Catapult.<br />
<br />
You can also download the Zip distribution which contains only the emulator
files (no installer) and unpack it to the directory of your choice.</dd>
<dt>macOS</dt>
<dd>The easiest way is to get the <code>.dmg</code> file from <a
class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/">our website</a> (check the Download
box). There is no Catapult for macOS, but Catapult isn't adding much value
anyway nowadays, as there is a built-in GUI now. </dd>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Debian GNU/Linux</dt>
<dd>Install the <code><a class="external"
href="http://packages.debian.org/openmsx">openmsx</a></code>,
<code>openmsx-data</code>, <code>cbios</code> and <code>openmsx-catapult</code>
packages. The simplest way is to run <code>apt install
openmsx-catapult</code>, APT will install the other needed packages as well.
</dd>
<dt>Ubuntu</dt>
<dd>The <a class="external"
href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmsx">Ubuntu packages</a> are
similar to the Debian ones. You can find them in the "universe" repository, so
make sure you have that enabled in your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.
</dd>
<dt>Fedora</dt>
<dd>Fedora has <a class="external"
href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=4949">packaged</a>
openMSX in the main archive since Fedora 7. You can just run <code>yum install
openmsx</code> to install openMSX.</dd>
<dt>Gentoo</dt>
<dd>You can find an ebuild for openMSX in the "games-emulation" category.
</dd>
<dt>openSUSE</dt>
<dd>openSUSE 10.3 (and 11.x) contains an openMSX package, but it seems to be somewhat outdated.</dd>
<dt>Mandriva</dt>
<dd>Source RPMs occasionally appear on the <a class="external" href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=openmsx">RPMFind.net search for openMSX</a>, but we don't know how to use them exactly or if they are also included in the official distribution.</dd>
<dt>ArchLinux</dt>
<dd>Packages are available for <a class="external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openmsx">openMSX</a> and <a class="external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openmsx-catapult">Catapult</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages">ArchLinux User-community Respository (AUR)</a>.</dd>
<dt>other</dt>
<dd>It is possible that openMSX has been packaged for other Linux systems as
well, but we are not able to keep track of all of them. Search for openMSX in your package management system and there's a fair chance that openMSX will pop
up. If it doesn't, look for "other", a few lines below.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD</dt>
<dd>There is a <a class="external" href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/emulators/openmsx">port for openMSX</a> in FreeBSD. It is simply called "openmsx". There is also a <a class="external" href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/emulators/catapult/">port for Catapult</a>.</dd>
<dt>NetBSD</dt>
<dd>There is a <a class="external" href="http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/emulators/openmsx/">port for openMSX</a> in NetBSD, but it seems to be somewhat outdated.
</dd>
<dt>other</dt>
<dd>Right. Sorry, but you'll have to install openMSX from source. This is not as complicated as it may sound, because we have automated most of the process and documented the rest. For clarity's sake: we're talking about the <a class="external" href="compile.html">Compilation Guide</a>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that in any case, no system ROMs are ever installed, so only the C-BIOS
machines work out-of-the-box. See also the next couple of questions.
</p>
<p>
If you still think openMSX is difficult to install, <a class="external" href="compile.html#contact">please tell us why</a>!
</p>

<h3><a id="ziporinstaller">Should I download the Zip or the Installer for Windows?</a></h3>

<p>
We strongly recommend to use the installer. It contains a straightforward
Windows Installer package.
With the installer, your openMSX experience is only about 3 clicks away. The
Zip file is meant for experienced users and those familiar with openMSX and
emulators in general.
</p>

<p>
The zip file may suggest that it is a "portable" version of the emulator, but
it isn't. It's exactly the same thing, just not packaged in the installer. The zip file 
still assumes the same paths as described in the <a class="external"
href="setup.html#romlocations">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="roms">Why doesn't openMSX come with system ROMs?</a></h3>

<p>
The MSX system ROMs are copyrighted. In other words: it's illegal to include
them in our software package without a license. The Setup Guide contains a <a
class="external" href="setup.html#systemroms">section about system ROMs</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="whereroms">Where do I install the system ROMs?</a></h3>

<p>System ROMs should be put in <code>share/systemroms</code>. Please see
the <a class="external" href="setup.html#romlocation">Setup Guide</a> for the
exact location for your operating system.
</p>
<p>
The quickest way to see where openMSX is searching for system ROMs on your
installation is via the GUI under <span class="menu-reference">Main menu bar
&rarr; Machine &rarr; Test MSX hardware...</span>. At the bottom of this dialog
you can find buttons to quickly open a (native) file browser on the locations
where the ROMs are searched for, both for the user folder and the system-wide
folder. We recommend to use the user folder, so that your system-wide folder
only contains the files that come with the openMSX installation.
</p>

<h3><a id="blackscreen">Why do I only get a black screen?</a></h3>

<p>
You may also see errors like "Error compiling shader".
</p>

<p>
You are probably mixing two installations of openMSX. Make sure that your
openMSX user directory (see <a class="external"
href="setup.html#romlocation">this overview where it is for your platform</a>)
does not have any openMSX installation stuff, only your own files, like system
ROMs and whatnot. Make sure no other folders (like
<code>share/shaders</code> or <code>share/scripts</code>) are there, as they may
interfere with the files that we ship with openMSX.
</p>

<h2><a id="use">Using openMSX</a></h2>

<h3><a id="easyuse">Is openMSX easy to use?</a></h3>

<p>
We sure hope so, especially with the built-in GUI nowadays. Still encountering problems using openMSX? We'd <a class="external" href="user.html#contact">love to hear about it</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although the GUI is quite comprehensive, it doesn't give you access to all
features of openMSX. Get access to all the features by using the openMSX built-in
console, and find out in <a class="external"
href="user.html#controlling">the User's Manual</a> how this works. It's not a GUI, but we still did
our best to make this console as easy to use as possible.
</p>

<p>
If you think openMSX is not easy to use, please tell us why! Contact info is in
<a class="external" href="user.html#contact">the manuals</a>.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you might wonder: why isn't the GUI looking more like other applications of
my operating system, like with (most) other emulators? We chose this GUI
toolkit, because it's independent of the operating system and it is easily
integrated into our code. This way we can support more operating systems with
the same amount of work (and developers) and make it easy for us to add new
features for everyone.
</p>

<h3><a id="c-bios">All I get is "No cartridge found." What's wrong?</a></h3>

<p>You are probably talking about this:</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="nocartfound.png" width="640" height="480" alt="No cartridge found.">
</p>

<p>openMSX doesn't come with any system ROMs, see <a class="internal"
href="#roms">Why doesn't openMSX come with system ROMs?</a>. To have something
to be able to run some software, openMSX comes with a free replacement of an
MSX BIOS ROM called <a class="external"
href="http://cbios.sourceforge.net/">C-BIOS</a>, written by BouKiChi, Reikan
and nowadays the C-BIOS Association. This is also what you can see in the
screen: C-BIOS 0.25.
</p>

<p>
The message, in other words, does not come from openMSX, but rather from C-BIOS, an MSX program which
tries to start a cartridge that is inserted in the MSX that is being emulated
by openMSX. And it seems you didn't insert any cartridge for it... So, either
run openMSX with a ROM image or <a class="internal"
href="setup.html#installrom">install real MSX system ROMs</a> for a particular
machine and run that one.
</p>

<p>Note that the current version of C-BIOS can only run cartridges and does not
support disk or tape usage. More information can be found in the <a
class="external" href="setup.html#cbios">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="nodrive">I get "Fatal error: No drive named 'diska'." What's wrong?</a></h3>

<p>You are probably using Catapult with C-BIOS and you're trying to run a program on a disk image.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the C-BIOS machines that come with openMSX do not support
disk or tape usage. Please see the <a class="external"
href="setup.html#cbios">Setup Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The tricky thing is that Catapult always shows the disk, tape and cartridge
controls, ignoring if the machine you're emulating actually supports
them. However, the built in GUI menus show
exactly what you can do with the currently running MSX: it only shows options
to insert a disk drive if there is actually a disk drive present on the system.
Please give it a try! It's the future of openMSX!</p>

<p>Until C-BIOS supports disks or tapes, you will have to
install the system ROMs of a real MSX (one with a disk drive!) and emulate that machine. More about this in the <a
class="external" href="setup.html#systemroms">Setup Guide</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="rundiskstapes">It looks like only ROMs are supported. How can I run disk and tape software?</a></h3>

<p>You are probably running the C-BIOS machines that came with openMSX and did
not install any system ROMs of other machines (or did not choose to emulate
another machine). The C-BIOS machines rely on the freely available C-BIOS ROMs
and that's why we can ship them with openMSX. However, C-BIOS only supports ROM
images for now. More information about that in the <a class="external"
href="setup.html#cbios">C-BIOS section of the Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>If you want to run software from other media (disks, tapes, etc.), you will
have to install other system ROMs, originating from real, existing MSX machines.
Then you can run MSX machines other than the C-BIOS machines, and which do support
tape and/or disk software (depending on the emulated MSX model). More about
this in the <a class="external" href="setup.html#systemroms">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="savegame">How do I save my game?</a></h3>

<h4><a id="savegame-general">In General</a></h4>

<p>
You've been playing a game and want to continue another time, so you want to
save your progress. You can either save your game as you would on a real MSX,
or you can use the built in <a class="external" href="user.html#savestate">save
state mechanism</a>, which is explained in the manual.
</p>

<p>If you consider that cheating, or are interested in how you could save your
game on a real MSX, read on... How it works, depends on the game:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Game Disk</dt>
<dd>Some disk-based games save on one of the game disks. Make sure the disk is
not write protected; in openMSX this means the disk image must be an ordinary
DSK image (not compressed as ZIP or XSA) and not read-only.
</dd>
<dt>Separate Disk</dt>
<dd>Some games save on a separate disk. You can create an empty disk for this
purpose by clicking on the plus-icon in the Disk Drive dialog (<span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Media &rarr; Disk Drive A</span>).
Since many games save in fixed sector locations instead of files, it is best to
reserve a separate save game disk for each game.
</dd>
<dt>PAC SRAM</dt>
<dd>The PAC and FMPAC contain a bit of battery-powered memory that can be used
for saving games. Make sure you insert the <code>pac</code> or
<code>fmpac</code> extension when you start openMSX.<br />
The SRAM is divided into 8 blocks and different games typically use different
blocks. However, there are many games using the SRAM, so it is unavoidable that
some games use the same block. If you play more than one game and want to be
on the safe side, copy the <code>.pac</code> file from "persistent/fmpac/untitled1" in your
openMSX user directory (see <a class="external"
href="setup.html#romlocation">this overview where it is for your platform</a>)
to a safe location.
</dd>
<dt>Game Master 2</dt>
<dd>The Game Master 2 can be used to save many Konami games. Insert both the
game cartridge and the Game Master 2 cartridge.
</dd>
<dt>Embedded SRAM</dt>
<dd>Some cartridges games, for example the strategic games from Koei, have SRAM
inside the cartridge. You don't have to do anything special to use this.</dd>
<dt>Tape</dt>
<dd>Saving to tape is a bit clumsy, but for some games it's the only way.
<br />Note that the current version of C-BIOS does not have tape support, so if
you want to save to tape, make sure you use a machine based on the original MSX
system ROMs.
</dd>
<dt>Password</dt>
<dd>Some games show a password that you can enter to resume the game at the
same point. You can write down the password of course, or type it into a text
file, but if you're really lazy, just make a screenshot (press PrtScr)!</dd>
</dl>

<h4><a id="savegame-mg">In Metal Gear</a></h4>

<p>
Many people wonder how to save in Metal Gear. Here we will explain how that is
done on a real MSX, which is also the way to go about it if you don't want to use the
built in <a class="external" href="user.html#savestate">save state
mechanism</a> of openMSX.
</p>

<p>
Metal Gear has two ways of saving games:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The usual way. This is the save option from the game itself:
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li> Press <strong>F1</strong> and then <strong>F5</strong> and you can
         save on tape. <br />
         For this to work, you need to use an MSX machine with a cassette port.
         (So, you cannot use C-BIOS machines, because they do not have a
         cassette port (yet)!)</li>
    <li> Insert a tape using the GUI: click <span class="menu-reference">Main
         menu bar &rarr; Media &rarr; Tape Deck</span> to open the Tape Deck
         control window. Press the button on the right with the circle
         and browse to the location where you want to create the new tape file
          with the name <code>my_save_game.wav</code>.</li>
    <li> Type the file name in the Metal Gear game (can be any name, but you
         need to remember it! Choose something easy. It's not related to the
         filename of the WAV file you just chose) and press enter.<br />
         The game will now save to that <code>my_save_game.wav</code> cassette
         image file, under the name you just entered.</li>
    <li> To verify: in Tape Deck window click the rewind button and then press
         "<strong>Y</strong>" in the game to verify.<br />
         You can also skip this step.</li>
 </ol>
<p>
Note that saving in this way is only useful after reaching the elevator. You
will continue in the last elevator you were in.</p>
</li>
<li> The special way. This is done with the Game Master 2 cartridge. You will
have to start openMSX with both the Metal Gear cartridge and the Game Master 2
cartridge. The Game Master 2 cartridge should be in a lower slot than Metal
Gear (if you use the command line, mention it before Metal Gear).
   <ol class="alpha">
    <li> After booting, select "<strong>GAME</strong>" to start Metal
    Gear.</li>
    <li> At any time during the game, press the MSX <strong>STOP</strong> key
    (<strong>F8</strong> in openMSX). <br />
    The CAPS LED will light, which means you are now in the Game Master mode.</li>
    <li> Press <strong>CTRL</strong> to open the save and load menu.<br />
         For this to work, you need to use an MSX with a diskdrive (again: not C-BIOS, yet!). </li>
    <li> Insert a (blank) disk in the openMSX diskdrive.<br />
         This can be a disk image you created with some external tool, but you
         can also create one from within openMSX itself: click on the plus-icon
         in the Disk Drive dialog (<span class="menu-reference">Main menu bar
         &rarr; Media &rarr; Disk Drive A</span>).  Then click Apply to insert
         the disk image in the drive. </li>
    <li> Choose "<strong>DISK SAVE</strong>" in the game from the menu.</li>
    <li> Choose "<strong>GAME DATA</strong>" in the DISK-SAVE menu.</li>
    <li> Input a filename for your save game. This will be the name of the file
         that that will end up on your disk image called <code>filename.dsk</code>.<br />
         The game will now be saved to disk.</li>
    <li> After saving, choose "<strong>END</strong>" and press the
         <strong>STOP</strong> key again (<strong>F8</strong>).<br />
         The game will resume. </li>
 </ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For loading back your game:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The usual way:
   <ol class="alpha">
     <li> Press <strong>F1</strong> and then <strong>F4</strong> in the game and you can load from tape.</li>
     <li> Insert the tape image into the cassetteplayer by clicking <span
          class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Media &rarr; Tape
          Deck</span> to open the Tape Deck and browsing for the previously
          created WAV tape image under "Select new tape" and then press Apply
          to insert it.</li>
     <li> Type the filename you choose for the save game in step 1c above. The
          game will now load the save game and start. If you want to retry, don't
          forget to rewind the cassette by clicking the rewind button in the
          Tape Deck window.</li>
   </ol>
 </li>
 <li>The special way:
   <ol class="alpha">
     <li> Start Metal Gear as described in steps 2a to 2c above in the saving
          instructions. </li>
     <li> In the save and load menu, choose "<strong>DISK LOAD</strong>". </li>
     <li> Insert the disk image which you inserted in step 2d above, to save
          your game on: in the Disk Drive dialog (<span class="menu-reference">Main menu bar
          &rarr; Media &rarr; Disk Drive A</span>), browse for the disk image
          and click Apply to insert the disk image in the drive. </li>
     <li> Choose "<strong>GAME DATA</strong>". </li>
     <li> The game will list the files on the disk that are save game files.
          Select the one you want to load and it will be loaded. </li>
     <li> Choose "<strong>END</strong>" and press the <strong>STOP</strong> key
          (<strong>F8</strong>) to resume the game. </li>
   </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="harddisk">What about openMSX harddisk support?</a></h3>

<p>
This is explained in the <a class="external" href="user.html#harddisks">User's
Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="videosource">It seems the MSX hangs when running GFX9000 software; what's wrong?</a></h3>

<p>You need to switch the video source of the emulated monitor to show the GFX9000 image.</p>

<p>For details, please see the corresponding section in the <a class="external"
href="user.html#gfx9000">User's Manual</a>. </p>

<h3><a id="leds">Great, those on-screen LEDs! How do I get rid of them?</a></h3>

<p>
Use the GUI menu: <span class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Settings
&rarr; Misc &rarr; Configure OSD icons...</span> and uncheck "Show OSD icons".
You can use this window also to configure them to your liking.
</p>

<h3><a id="commands">Where is the full list of commands and settings?</a></h3>

<p>
The full list of commands and settings that are available in the console can be found in the
<a class="external" href="commands.html">Console Command Reference</a>. Check it out, it's really useful!
</p>
<p>
There is also a full alphabetical list of settings in the GUI under Settings
&rarr; Advanced. This is a very long list though, and we might remove it later
as it is not very easy to use.
</p>

<h3><a id="slow">How can I speed up openMSX? How hard is it to emulate an old MSX on a modern PC?</a></h3>

<p>
Actually, openMSX is quite fast, depending on what you ask it to do. If you
have minimal hardware, you should use minimal settings as well, to get decent
speed. This was proven by Karloch who ran openMSX 0.6.0 on a 206MHz HP Jornada
720, see <a class="external"
href="https://www.msx.org/forum/semi-msx-talk/emulation/openmsx-arm-without-x-window">this
thread on MRC</a>. On PCs, it really helps if your graphics card
(or actually, the pipe between the CPU and the graphics card) is not slow. Tips on how to
performance tune openMSX can be found in the <a class="external"
href="setup.html#tuning">Setup Guide</a>. The developers do their best to keep
the performance of openMSX as good as possible, while still achieving the
highest possible level of accuracy.
</p>
<p>
People often wonder why you would need 200MHz+ machines to emulate computers
based on 3.5MHz CPUs. The thing is, there's not only the CPU you have to emulate, you also
have to emulate the VDP (21MHz), the monitor (writing at least 50 times per
second at least 256&times;192 pixels to a window), the sound chips, etc. This
is relatively simple hardware, but having that run in software with clock cycle
accuracy is quite heavy. In general, it is a lot of work for a general purpose
CPU to emulate functionality that was originally made in dedicated hardware.
Rebuilding an MSX in general purpose hardware (using VHDL on FPGA) is already a
lot less demanding. An example of this is the One Chip MSX.

<h3><a id="perfect_videos">How do I create perfect play videos, like Vampier's YouTube videos?</a></h3>

<p>
The trick is to use the <a class="external"
href="user.html#reverse">reverse</a> feature to correct any mistakes you make
during game play. You just play, play, play, correcting all mistakes you make
by going back in time a bit (using PageUp) when you (e.g.) die and doing it
better.
</p>
<p>As soon as you get to the end of the game, we recommend to save the whole
replay with <span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Save state &rarr; Save
replay...</span>, so that you
can always load it and play it again (using <span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Save state &rarr; Load
replay...</span>).
</p>
<p>Next step is to pause openMSX, load back the replay (if you saved it) or
simply go back to the complete start (click at the start of the reverse bar, or
use the command <a class="external" href="commands.html#reverse"><code>reverse
goto 0</code></a>). Now you're ready to record your heroic movie! (Note: if you
want to record a video from a later point in time, just let it play until it
reaches the right position, or click on another part of the reverse bar, or
just search a bit with PageUp/PageDown.)
</p>
<p>As a final step, <a class="external" href="user.html#recording">start
recording</a> and unpause openMSX. If you want the video quickly, run in <a
class="external" href="commands.html#throttle">full throttle</a> (F9 by
default) to speed things up. The resulting movie will be the same. If you want
to split up the recorded video in chunks of under 15 minutes that are accepted
by YouTube on unverified channels, you'll probably want to have a look at the <a class="external"
href="commands.html#record">record_chunks</a> command.
</p>

<p>
Easy! Now fill up YouTube with MSX material!

<h3><a id="tas">How do I use openMSX for TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedruns)?</a></h3>

<p>If just creating <a href="#perfect_videos">perfect play videos</a> isn't
enough for you, you are probably going for Tool-Assisted Speedruns - more 
information on <a class="external"
href="http://tasvideos.org">tasvideos.org</a>. The rest of this item gives you
some hints to help you with this.
</p>

<p>First of all, the basics are explained in the previous section, of course.
But you can get extra tools if you enable the <a class="external"
href="commands.html#mode">TAS mode</a>, we're just not going to repeat the
explanation here.
If you need also a live RAM watch, check out the <code><a class="external"
href="commands.html#other">ram_watch</a></code> command. It enables you to add
live views of values on multiple addresses with several view options, like
titles, formats and data types. Please also try the similar functionality under <span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Debugger &rarr; Watch
expression</span>, which is even more powerful.
</p>

<p>For MSX TASing, we recommend to not use the (default) C-BIOS based machines,
but real machines, because C-BIOS is still in development and this means your
replay (called "movie" in most other TASing emulators) won't be easy to get
working again once a new version of C-BIOS has been released. Also, MSX turboR
machines are not recommended, because their emulation has a relatively large amount of
timing inaccuracies. So which machines do we recommend? Here's a table with
some very rough directions:</p>
 <table>
    <tr> <th>game type</th>                         <th>machine</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Japanese/Korean (MSX/MSX2/MSX2+)</td>  <td>Panasonic FS-A1WSX</td></tr>
    <tr> <td>European (MSX/MSX2)</td>               <td>Philips NMS 8250 + FMPAC</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>This is mostly motivated by the fact that Japanese machines run at 60Hz
interrupt frequency and the Japanese games are made for that. Besides, you will
get proper Japanese characters with a Japanese machine, which are often used in
such games. The mentioned machine can run practically all Japanese
MSX/MSX2/MSX2+ games and has FM on board. For European games, the 50Hz (PAL)
Philips NMS 8250 is recommended, just because it's very common and runs most
European MSX and MSX2 software. The FMPAC extension is for better sound. There
are no native European MSX2+ machines.</p>

<p>When doing MSX TASing, be aware that (unlike consoles), MSX machines have
a full keyboard attached, and touching the keyboard provides input to the MSX, which in turn
means you will interrupt the replay if it's playing. You can avoid this (when
merely viewing a replay) by using the <code>-viewonly</code> option when using
the <a class="external" href="user.html#reverse">reverse loadreplay</a>
command. The keyboard problem also means that it's a bit tricky to assign
keyboard shortcuts (with the <code><a class="external"
href="commands.html#bind">bind</a></code> command) to (e.g. TAS) functions,
without also blocking MSX keys. So, be careful which keyboard shortcuts you
configure and which keys you press.</p>

<p>Now it's time to make a TAS and submit your entry on <a class="external"
href="http://tasvideos.org">tasvideos.org</a>!</p>

<p>A final note: if you have problems replaying other people's TAS (or other
openMSX replays), because openMSX can't find the required media (ROMs, disks,
tapes, etc.), make sure you put the required media in the proper <code><a
class="external" href="commands.html#filepool">filepool</a></code>; by default
<code>share/software</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="disablereverse">How can I disable reverse or the reverse bar time line?</a> </h3>

<p>
Using reverse in combination with large (hard disk or SD card) media can be
slow at start-up, as openMSX needs to calculate a hash of the media to know
whether it changed. Moreover, if you reverse and the hard disk image changed,
openMSX will switch to read-only mode for the media. This is because currently,
when reversing, openMSX does not revert changes to media, so replaying these
may cause corruption on the media e.g. due to double writes.
</p>

<p>In other words, if you are using large media and you don't really need the reverse
feature, you probably want to disable it: use the  <span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Save state &rarr; Reverse/replay
settings &rarr; Enable reverse/replay</span> checkbox. And if you don't want it
to restart again anymore, uncheck  <span class="menu-reference">Main menu bar
&rarr; Save state &rarr; Reverse/replay settings &rarr; Auto enable
reverse</span>.
</p>

<p>Perhaps you don't want to disable reverse necessarily, but
you're working with the mouse a lot and the reverse bar shown on the screen is getting in
the way. In such a case you can get rid of the bar by toggling the setting using <span
class="menu-reference">Main menu bar &rarr; Save state &rarr; Reverse/replay
settings &rarr; Show reverse bar</span>. Alternatively, if you still
want to see it, but not in the area where the MSX display is shown, you can
move it out of the main window by right-clicking the bar, unchecking "Hide
title", checking "Allow move" and then drag the whole bar out of the main
window.
<p>

<h2><a id="other">Other</a></h2>

<h3><a id="codec">What codec do you use to record videos and where do I get it (because I only get eternal darkness in my videos)?</a></h3>

<p>
The ZMBV (Zip Motion Blocks Video) codec is used, which has been developed in
the <a class="external" href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/">DosBox
project</a>. It enables openMSX to encode video in real time (on most systems),
has a very good compression ratio and gives excellent video quality, because it
is a lossless codec. Razor sharp movies! Also, because the encoder is built in,
it doesn't make openMSX depend on an external codec to be installed for
recording video.
</p>

<p>
A developer of DosBox built a Win32 binary of the codec for our users. It is
included with openMSX 0.6.2 (and up) for Win32. Note that the installer does
not install the codec by default, so you will need to enable this option when
installing. You can also <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.org/util/zmbv_codec_win32.zip">download the codec
separately from our web site</a>. After unzipping the file, use the .INF file
to install the codec (<code>zmbv.dll</code>) by right-clicking on it and
selecting Install. Note that other binaries of this codec that you can find on
the internet may not work, as not all of them have support for more than 8 bits
per pixel recordings.
Also note that this is a 32-bit codec, so it will not run inside 64-bit Windows
Media Player or Windows Media Center.
</p>

<p>
You only need this codec installer to be able to replay the videos on a Windows
system. (Although a workaround could be to upload it to YouTube, where it
is re-encoded into a lossy MPEG-4 format.) Programs like Virtual Dub can use
the codec and re-encode it in another way. On other operating systems, you can
use any video player which supports this codec; e.g. <code>mplayer</code>.
Re-encoding can be done with e.g. <code>mencoder</code>.

<h3><a id="soundproblems">Why do I hear serious sound glitches and/or stuttering, especially when using Windows?</a></h3>

<p>
Not sure, but for some reason, especially on Windows, we can't find default
settings that work for everyone. If you indeed have glitches like sound delay
or stuttering, you can try the following. </p>

<ul>
 <li>Chances are that your CPU load is very high, which may cause stutters.
 Check the <a class="external" href="setup.html#tuning">Performance Tuning</a>
 section of the Setup Guide to see what you can do to get it lower. Also, peaks
 in CPU usage (e.g. caused by certain P2P programs) can cause stuttering, in
 some cases.</li>
 <li>Try to tune the value of the <a class="external"
 href="commands.html#samples"><code>samples</code></a> setting. If you have
 stutters, double it and see if that helps. If you have delays, halve it and
 see if that helps.</li>
</ul>
