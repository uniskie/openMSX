This file is a small and simple list of programs(mostly games and demo's) and why they make interesting test case for an MSX emulator:

Time Curb:
Beside that it is a nice test for tape support, the most interesting thing is the samples played(Time curb, world war one, world war two, etc...). The program puts the PSG channels on hold, so that they output a constant value (== like a zero frequency) and then uses the volume to alter the output voltage to play samples.

Hydefoss:
A screensplit that switches between screen 5 and 4

Quinpl:
Detects v9958 by register ??

F1 spirit 3d:
Scroll registers at every line during gameplay

Track and Field:
Di when the VDP set the interrupt, so the emulator must react immediately on this pending interrupt when the EI instruction is executed.

Calculus:
Heli-part: uses screen 3 and magnified sprites
Aquarel: 'illegal' use of vdp(2) combined with vdp(24)
Picture: interlaced screen7 with vdp(24) trickery

Compass:
212 lines on screen 0, 4 colors

Unknown Reality:
- vdp(19) to increase from 212 to 228 lines
  when displaying the logo on the chequered background
- horizontal screensplit when displaying the scope-picture
  beside the scrolling text


Good example needed for
overscan trick
