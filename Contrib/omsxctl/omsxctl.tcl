# omsxctl -- execute openMSX commands from within an MSX program
#
# This script should NOT be installed in the ~/.openmsx/share/scripts directory
# (because you don't want it to be active every time you start openMSX). Instead
# you should activate it via the openMSX command line with the option '-script
# omsxctl.tcl'.
#
# Typically used in combination with the MSX-DOS 'omsxctl.com' utility.
#
# But can also be used from any other MSX program with a code snippet like
# this:
#   ld   hl,command    ; pointer to the to be executed command
#   ld   de,result     ; the result of the command is written here
#   ld   bc,resultSize ; size of the result buffer (set to 0 if result is not needed)
#   out  (#2d),a       ; the value of A doesn't matter
#   jp   c,error       ; carry-flag set if there was an error executing the command
#                      ; BC is set to the actual length of the result string,
#                      ; or set to 0xffff when the result buffer was too small,
#                      ; in that case the result is still written to [DE] but truncated.
#
# Limitations:
#  Strings containing characters >=128 are not handled well:
#  - For passing the command string from the MSX to openMSX this could be
#    fixed (but is it worth it?).
#  - For passing the result from openMSX to the MSX I currently don't see a
#    solution that handles both arbitrary utf-8 strings and binary data (e.g.
#    created via the 'binary format' Tcl command). The current implementation
#    chooses to handle binary data (and of course pure ASCII strings work fine
#    as well).
