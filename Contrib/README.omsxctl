omsxctl -- execute openMSX commands from within an MSX program

This is a combination of a Tcl script and a MSX-DOS utility. It allows to
execute arbitrary openMSX console commands from within the MSX.

Files:
  omsxctl.tcl   The Tcl script.
  omsxctl.com   The MSX-DOS utility.
  omsxctl.z80   The source code for the above utility (Z80 assembly code).

The use this, pass the script on the openMSX command line:
  openmsx -script <path-to>/omsxctl.tcl
And then in MSX-DOS execute something like:
  omsxctl set save-settings_on_exit false
  omsxctl set throttle off
  omsxctl after time 10 "exit 1"
  ...
  omsxctl exit

Check the script and utility source code more (technical) details.

You can use this script/utility as-is. But as always, feel free to extend it
for your specific needs. E.g. you might want to integrate this directly in
your MSX program instead of using the omsxctl.com utility.
