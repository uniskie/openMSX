### basictorom.tcl ###
#
# This script was developed together with Daniel Vik to have an automated tool
# to convert BASIC programs to ROM files. See this forum thread for more
# details:
#
#   http://www.msx.org/forumtopic9249.html
#
# To use it, put a file 'prog.bas' in the current directory (can be either in
# ascii format or an already tokenized basic file). Then execute this script by
# using the openMSX commandline. And after a few seconds the ROM image
# 'prog.rom' will be generated.
#
#   input: prog.bas
#   output prog.rom
#   start with:  openmsx -script basictorom.tcl
#
# Note: This script only works on MSX machines that have a disk drive and have
#       MSX-BASIC built-in. So for example it won't work on the default C-bios
#       based machines. So either select a different MSX machine as your
#       default machine, or pass the '-machine <machine-config>' as extra
#       option when starting openMSX.
#

proc do_stuff1 {} {
  # insert openMSX ramdisk in the MSX disk drive
  diska ramdsk

  # import host file to ramdisk
  diskmanipulator import diska "prog.bas"
